                        <li>1/2 cup sugar (for paneer balls)</li>
                        <li>4–5 cardamom pods, crushed</li>
                        <li>A few strands of saffron</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon rose water (optional)</li>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Boil 4 cups of water with 1/2 cup sugar to make a light syrup. Gently cook the paneer/chenna balls in this syrup
                            for 10–12 minutes. Remove and let them cool.</li>
                        <li>In a separate pan, bring 4 cups of milk to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until it thickens slightly.</li>
                        <li>Add 1/2 cup sugar to the milk, along with crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands. Stir well to dissolve sugar
                            completely.</li>
                        <li>Gently squeeze excess syrup from the paneer balls and add them to the flavored milk.</li>
                        <li>Simmer for 5–10 minutes to let the flavors infuse.</li>
                        <li>Add rose water if using and mix gently.</li>
                        <li>Remove from heat and let the Rasmalai cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for a few hours.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds before serving.</li>
                    </ol>
