    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Tikka is a popular Indian dish made by marinating chunks of chicken in a mixture of yogurt and aromatic spices,
        then grilling or baking them until perfectly cooked. The result is tender, juicy chicken with a smoky, flavorful crust.</p>
        <p>This dish is often served as an appetizer or as part of a main meal with naan, rice, or a fresh salad. The marinade can
        be customized to be mild or spicy, making it a versatile favorite for both everyday meals and special occasions.</p>
